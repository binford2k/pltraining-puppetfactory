# Puppet doesn't give us the ability to override the default provider from
# within a module. This is evil hackery to modify the existing providers
# so that the classroom family of providers will be chosen by students, but
# so that the original provider will be used by the instructor
#
#                       DANGER WILL ROBINSON!
#
# This class will likely render the machine unusable for other purposes,
# especially if the module is later removed.
